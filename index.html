        <h1>A Study on the Radioactivity of Curium</h1>
        <hr>
        <p6>
            With 96 protons, 96 electrons, and an average of 247 neutrons, curium proves to be
            one of the more interesting elements on the Periodic Table.

                <div id="originInfo"><p1>An artificially produced element, curium was initially discovered and syntehsized 
                in 1944 at the University of California, Berkeley. It has been produced in 
                particle accelerators by ramming lighter elements with alpha particles, the 
                most common being Pu-239 to produce Cm-242 and a neutron.One of the most common isotopes of curium, Cm-242 has a half-life of 
                    162.8 days and undergoes alpha decay to produce Pu-238.</p1><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/21/55/c7/2155c7e6829fc6e4d5b1c9942fbbe0df.png"></div>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Since Cm-242 and Cm-247 can produce as much as 120 W/g and 3 W/g, respectively, 
                            they're commonly used in radioisotope thermoelectric generators, like those 
                            in spacecraft.
                        </li>
                        <li>With its long half-life, Cm-242 can be used to produce Pu-238, which is used 
                            in cardiac peacemakers.
                        </li>
                        <li>Cm-244 is commonly used in alpha particle X-ray spectrometers, used in space and Mars 
                            exploration missions.

                <article>
                    Even though curium usually emits alpha particles during their decay, 
                    some if its decay products emit significant amounts of beta and gamma radiation. 
                    If consumed, the portion of curium that is not excreted travels to the blood, liver, 
                    and the bones. This stops bone marrow production and red blood cell creation, leading to 
                    bone tumors and liver cancer When inhaled, curium has also been known to cause lung cancer.

                    <li>Curium is so radioactive that it glows in the dark.</li>
                    <li>Cm-247, the most "stable" of the radioisotopes, has a half-life of 15,600,000 years.</li>
                    <li>Because of its unique structure, C-242 can undergo spontaneous fission.</li>
                    <li>Cm-242 generates about three watts of thermal energy per gram, more than plutonium produces (yes, the element used in A-bombs :) ).</li>
